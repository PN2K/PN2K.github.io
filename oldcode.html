The wristbands are also debossed with three words that exemplify how Phyo chose to live each moment of his life: Cherish. Share. Grow.

		<h2>Bike Safety @ MIT</h2>

	<img src="images/ghost_bike.jpg" alt="Bike Safety" style="width:350px; padding:0 20px; background:none; float:right" />

	<p>Wandering along Massachusetts Avenue and Vassar Street, you might have seen the ghost bike that one of Phyo’s kind co-workers, <font color="yellow">Andrea Schneider</font>, set up in his memory. Thank you to those who have taken the time and care to replace the flowers with fresh ones from time to time. We send lots of gratitude as well to MIT for allowing us to keep this bike there in memory of Phyo. Special thanks to <font color="yellow">Mr. Norman Magnuson</font> from MIT facilities for taking care of this bike and locking it up inside during harsh Boston winter storms!
	</p><br>
	<p><font color="yellow">WHAT:</font> We are in the process of working with MIT Campus Police to implement a new bicycle safety program for the MIT community to be held during MIT Orientation of 2014. This program will have both an educational and “hands-on” component, where students will have the chance to put into practice the safe biking skills taught in less than an hour. We hope that by retelling Phyo’s story and informing the MIT community of the real dangers of cycling, we can look after each other’s safety! 
	</p><br>
	<p style="margin-bottom:5px;"><font color="yellow">PARTNERS:</font> Thank you to the following supporters that we will be working with to make this bike safety event happen!

	<p>Do you want to make cycling safer in Boston? Are you an EMT? Are you involved with your school’s cycling team and want to promote your rights on the street? We would love to hear from you, especially if you would like to spearhead efforts in Cambridge/Boston that promote bike safety. We are dedicated to educating incoming students about their rights and responsibilities as cyclists and about 
		tricky intersections and dangerous streets (including familiarizing them with the streets of Cambridge and Boston via bike tours).
